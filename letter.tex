\opening{Dear Scott Bakula,}

We are the Oxford Star Trek Society, and we've been enjoying Trek as a
society of university students since 1990. We watch Trek together
every Monday and have a variety of other social events too across each
term. As you might imagine, we are big fans of yours. As such we would
like to offer you honorary membership and, if you accept, would be
very grateful if you could sign and return the enclosed photo for our
membership book (we've enclosed a pre-paid and addressed envelope).

Also on behalf of the society, I am inviting you to come visit us if
you are ever in Oxford and it is convenient for you. We can be
contacted at:

{\large oxfordstartrek@gmail.com}

We hope to hear from you soon.

\closing{Live Long and Prosper,}
  
\end{letter}
